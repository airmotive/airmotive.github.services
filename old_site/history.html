        grew up, spending some of their time at the airport.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wayne, 
        Sr. accumulated aircraft that he used for crop dusting, giving flight 
        instruction and having aircraft available for rent.&nbsp; It took long 
        hours and much hard work to keep things going.&nbsp; There were improvements 
        made at the airport.&nbsp; Runway lights were installed&nbsp;in the early 
        1960's and they were on every night.&nbsp; The T-hangars on the north 
        were there.&nbsp; There were underground and above ground fuel tanks.</font></font></p>
